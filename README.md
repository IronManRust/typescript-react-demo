# TypeScript React Demo

---

This is a reference demo, written in TypeScript, that illustrates features and design patterns applicable to a more substantial React-based application.

## TODO List

* Set additional `.eslintrc` rules.
* Set additional `tslint.json` rules.
* Setup HTTP server hosting step.
* Setup `typedoc` once the package is fixed.
